# 🛒 Grocery Sales Prediction

## 🔍 Project Overview
This project focuses on **predicting grocery store sales** using machine learning techniques. By analyzing historical sales data, we aim to forecast future revenue and identify key factors influencing sales.

## 📑 Workflow

1. **Data Collection & Preprocessing**
   - Load and clean grocery sales dataset.
   - Handle missing values and outliers.
   - Perform feature engineering to create new predictors.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Visualize sales trends and seasonality.
   - Analyze feature importance using correlation and statistical methods.
3. **Machine Learning Model Development**
   - Train models including **Linear Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forest**.
   - Tune hyperparameters for optimal performance.
4. **Model Evaluation & Insights**
   - Compute **R² Score, RMSE, and MAE**.
   - Compare model predictions against actual sales values.

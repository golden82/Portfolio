# 🛒 SuperKart Sales Prediction

## 📌 Project Overview
SuperKart is a retail chain that operates supermarkets and food marts across multiple cities. The goal of this project is to build a predictive model that estimates future sales revenue for different SuperKart outlets based on historical sales data. Accurate sales forecasting is crucial for optimizing sales operations, inventory management, and supply chain planning.

## 🎯 Objective
The primary objective is to develop a machine learning model that predicts **total store sales** based on product attributes, store characteristics, and location-specific factors. The insights derived from this model will help SuperKart strategize its sales operations across different city tiers and plan inventory accordingly.

## 📂 Dataset Description
The dataset consists of sales records from multiple stores for a specific time period. It includes:
- **Product-related features**: ID, weight, sugar content, allocated display area, MRP, product type.
- **Store-related features**: Store ID, establishment year, size, location city type, store type.
- **Target variable**: `Product_Store_Sales_Total` - Total revenue generated by a product in a store.

### 🔍 Data Fields:
| Column                        | Description |
|--------------------------------|-------------|
| `Product_Id`                  | Unique product identifier |
| `Product_Weight`              | Weight of the product |
| `Product_Sugar_Content`       | Sugar level (Low Sugar, Regular, No Sugar) |
| `Product_Allocated_Area`      | Display area allocation ratio |
| `Product_Type`                | Product category (e.g., Dairy, Snacks, Beverages) |
| `Product_MRP`                 | Maximum Retail Price |
| `Store_Id`                    | Unique store identifier |
| `Store_Establishment_Year`    | Year the store was established |
| `Store_Size`                  | Store size (Small, Medium, Large) |
| `Store_Location_City_Type`    | Tier classification of store’s city |
| `Store_Type`                  | Store type (Supermarket, Departmental, Food Mart) |
| `Product_Store_Sales_Total`   | Total revenue from product sales in a store |

## 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- **Data Cleaning**: Checked for missing values and handled them appropriately.
- **Feature Engineering**:
  - Created `Store_Age_Years` feature from the store establishment year.
  - Categorized products into "Perishables" and "Non-Perishables."
- **EDA Insights**:
  - `Fruits and Vegetables` and `Snack Foods` generate the highest revenue.
  - Sales performance varies by store type and city tier.
  - `Supermarket Type 2` stores contribute the highest revenue.
  - Stores in **Tier 2** cities generate the most sales.

## 🏗️ Model Building
### 🔢 Data Preprocessing
- Encoded categorical features using **One-Hot Encoding**.
- Scaled numerical features.
- Split the dataset into **train (70%)** and **test (30%)** sets.

### 📈 Algorithms Implemented
1. **Linear Regression**
2. **Decision Trees**
3. **Random Forest**
4. **Gradient Boosting (XGBoost)**
5. **Neural Networks (TensorFlow/Keras)**

## 📊 Model Evaluation
- Metrics used: **R² Score, RMSE, MAE**
- **Random Forest & XGBoost** provided the best accuracy.
- Hyperparameter tuning improved performance.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, XGBoost)
- **Data Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Modeling**: Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, XGBoost, Neural Networks

## 🔮 Key Findings & Recommendations
- **Product Pricing**: Stores selling high MRP products tend to have higher revenues.
- **Store Strategy**: Focus on **Supermarket Type 2** stores for revenue maximization.
- **Inventory Planning**: Allocate more shelf space to high-revenue categories (`Fruits & Vegetables`, `Snacks`).
- **City-wise Expansion**: Invest in **Tier 2** cities where demand is highest.

## 📌 Next Steps
- Improve model interpretability using **SHAP values**.
- Deploy the model as an API for real-time sales predictions.
- Explore deep learning models for further accuracy improvements.
